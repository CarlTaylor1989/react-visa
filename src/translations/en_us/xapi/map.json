  "description": "The main area learners engage with in the game. Here the learner’s goal is to work their way from the centre of the map to the end of each Line, which represent Visa product families (e.g. Identity and Security). Each family includes a number of product rails learners must complete by taking a sequence of mini-challenges that test the learner’s understanding of that product. Each product family and zone has an associated color, just like a metro map. The learner can start their journey from any point, taking a series of sequential challenges to ‘complete’ products and score points."
