    "text": "<p>Rishu Parikh, a Finance Manager for Zephyr Bank, has recently made contact with you on behalf of his client Big Talks. Big Talks, an offshoot of Ted Talks, is a large company that travels the globe offering inspirational talks, encouraging discussion and challenging outdated perceptions of disability. They were recently announced as a top five company globally for disabled workers.</p><p>Big Talks has seen an increase in travel spend due to their goal to become the most popular company of their kind in Europe. Not only have they increased the frequency with which they travel, each trip is fairly expensive due to the varying travel requirements of each employee. Airfare, taxis and hotels need to have enough room to accommodate support staff, as well as things like wheelchairs and walking aids. Due to the varying travel requirements of each employee, the company has struggled to decide on a formal travel policy, and this has created an influx of employees putting travel expenses on their personal cards or travel agencies sending them a bill at the end of the month. Travel agency bills often arrive late too.</p><p>The current process is a pain point throughout the company, causing stress and wasting time.</p><p>Rishu is looking to find the client a solution that simplifies the expenses process.</p><p>Are you ready to discuss his needs in more detail?</p>"
